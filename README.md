## Problem Description

Food classification plays a crucial role in various applications, from dietary monitoring to restaurant menu analysis. The challenge lies in accurately categorizing diverse food items into specific groups. This project aims to address the following challenges:

1. **Diverse Food Categories:** The dataset encompasses a wide range of food categories, each with its own unique visual characteristics, making accurate classification challenging.

2. **Limited Data Availability:** In some categories, obtaining a sufficient amount of labeled data for training can be a hurdle, leading to potential biases and performance issues.

3. **Model Generalization:** Achieving a model that generalizes well across different food types and variations is a key objective, considering the practical application of food classification in various scenarios.

### Dataset Overview

This dataset contains 16,643 food images grouped into 11 major food categories: **Bread, Dairy product, Dessert, Egg, Fried food, Meat, Noodles-Pasta, Rice, Seafood, Soup, Vegetable-Fruit**.

The dataset is divided into three splits: **evaluation, training, and validation**, and each split includes images of the 11 food categories.
